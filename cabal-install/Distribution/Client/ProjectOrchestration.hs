-- | This module deals with building and incrementally rebuilding a collection
-- of packages. It is what backs the @cabal build@ and @configure@ commands,
-- as well as being a core part of @run@, @test@, @bench@ and others. 
--
-- The primary thing is in fact rebuilding (and trying to make that quick by
-- not redoing unnecessary work), so building from scratch is just a special
-- case.
--
-- The build process and the code can be understood by breaking it down into
-- three major parts:
--
-- * The 'ElaboratedInstallPlan' type
--
-- * The \"what to do\" phase, where we look at the all input configuration
--   (project files, .cabal files, command line etc) and produce a detailed
--   plan of what to do -- the 'ElaboratedInstallPlan'.
--
-- * The \"do it\" phase, where we take the 'ElaboratedInstallPlan' and we
-- re-execute it.
--
-- As far as possible, the \"what to do\" phase embodies all the policy, leaving
-- the \"do it\" phase policy free. The first phase contains more of the
-- complicated logic, but it is contained in code that is either pure or just
-- has read effects (except cache updates). Then the second phase does all the
-- actions to build packages, but as far as possible it just follows the
-- instructions and avoids any logic for deciding what to do (apart from
-- recompilation avoidance in executing the plan).
--
-- This division helps us keep the code under control, making it easier to
-- understand, test and debug. So when you are extending these modules, please
-- think about which parts of your change belong in which part. It is
-- perfectly ok to extend the description of what to do (i.e. the 
-- 'ElaboratedInstallPlan') if that helps keep the policy decisions in the
-- first phase. Also, the second phase does not have direct access to any of
-- the input configuration anyway; all the information has to flow via the
-- 'ElaboratedInstallPlan'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Taking targets into account, selecting what to build
--

-- | Given a set of 'UserBuildTarget's, resolve which 'UnitId's and
-- 'ComponentTarget's they ought to refer to.
--
-- The idea is that every user target identifies one or more roots in the
-- 'ElaboratedInstallPlan', which we will use to determine the closure
-- of what packages need to be built, dropping everything from the plan
-- that is unnecessary. This closure and pruning is done by
-- 'pruneInstallPlanToTargets' and this needs to be told the roots in terms
-- of 'UnitId's and the 'ComponentTarget's within those.
--
-- This means we first need to translate the 'UserBuildTarget's into the
-- 'UnitId's and 'ComponentTarget's. This translation has to be different for
-- the different command line commands, like @build@, @repl@ etc. For example
-- the command @build pkgfoo@ could select a different set of components in
-- pkgfoo than @repl pkgfoo@. The @build@ command would select any library and
-- all executables, whereas @repl@ would select the library or a single
-- executable. Furthermore, both of these examples could fail, and fail in
-- different ways and each needs to be able to produce helpful error messages.
--
-- So 'resolveTargets' takes two helpers: one to select the targets to be used
-- by user targets that refer to a whole package ('BuildTargetPackage'), and
-- another to check user targets that refer to a component (or a module or
-- file within a component). These helpers can fail, and use their own error
-- type. Both helpers get given the 'AvailableTarget' info about the
-- component(s).
--
-- While commands vary quite a bit in their behavior about which components to
-- select for a whole-package target, most commands have the same behaviour for
-- checking a user target that refers to a specific component. To help with
-- this commands can use 'selectComponentTargetBasic', either directly or as
-- a basis for their own @selectComponentTarget@ implementation.
